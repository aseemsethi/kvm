You can simply type:
  $ make
to build a 16-bit binary that uses the i8086 instruction set.

Disassembling
-------------

Use the "-m i8086" command line option with objdump to make sure it knows we're
dealing with i8086 instruction set:

  $ objdump -d -m i8086 i8086.elf

Convert to C language array by:
[asethi@localhost kernel]$ ./bin2c -i ../kernel/kernel.bin -o as
